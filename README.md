## Fancy meeting you here 👋

I am Mattia, student of the **Big Data Engineer** course powered by Randstad.
I am a data engineer studying and practicing with data everyday. My focus is machine learning, analysis and data modeling. 
I work with Relational and Documental DBs, Neural Networks, business intelligence and ETL tools.
Always open to try new things and collaborate on exciting, new projects!

Data is a wonderful field: it's deep, complex and very telling about more aspects of our life than we can see at first glance. That's what I love about this field.
They say that data is the new gold so... let's strike it rich! And have some fun along the way.
